Welcome to the **Lokapal Foundations Glossary**, a central reference point for key terms and symbolic elements used throughout the *Conciliatorics* project.

This glossary is divided into two focused sections:

ðŸ”¹**[Definitions](../definitions/)** â€” A curated list of core concepts, theoretical terms, and systemological language developed or redefined within *Conciliatorics*.

ðŸ”¹**[Symbols Glossary](../symbols/)** â€” A guide to the symbolic language of *Conciliatorics*, including visual signs, notational systems, and interpretive cues used throughout diagrams and conceptual models.

Each section is designed to support both newcomers and returning readers, offering clarity and consistency as you explore the ideas presented in Lokapal Foundations.

Whether youâ€™re looking for a quick refresher or a deeper understanding of the project's conceptual vocabulary, this glossary is here to assist.
