title: 'About Conciliatorics'
---

*Conciliatorics* is the philosophical foundation of *Lokapal*, developed over more than 20 years of analytical exploration and practical experience. It investigates the interplay between interstitial and intrinsic aspects of reality, ultimately arguing that decentralization is essential for achieving systemic balance and resilience.

## About the author

Conciliatorics is a personal research project by **Ricardo Pintos**. It draws from his experiences as a professional optician and physical therapist, his creative process as a musician and dancer, and his analytical path as a philosopher and teacher. Each of these domains revealed clues about a deeper need for reconciliation between the intrinsic and the interstitial.

Sparse notes on this synthesis gradually evolvedâ€”first into isolated ideas, and eventually into an integrated framework. This journey is ongoing. Much refinement and research still lie ahead. Ricardo remains committed to expanding these ideas and applying them to the development of decentralized systems.

## A Philosophical Framework for DAOs

As the foundation of Lokapalâ€™s work, *Conciliatorics* offers a theoretical basis for exploring decentralized governance. It serves as a guiding lens for DAO design, governance security, and systemic resilience.
